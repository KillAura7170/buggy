# buggy
This repo has all the weirdest and buggy software in the world that are written by me!.
1) 
   main.c is a os detection tool that is suppost to connect to a remoat mainframe and interact with a built in console. Alltho the public will never get the actuall software I wanted to share a very early version of this. This version has a weird bug where if lets say I type cpu_info in the console it will just spit out bunch of "[/]: ". And the longer the string that you enter is more of this "[/]: " you will get. If you are cool open an issue with a fix and I will tell you if its the method I used or not ;)
# More coming soon!
